## Introduction

The traditional real estate industry often involves numerous intermediaries, extensive paperwork, and a lack of transparency. RealEstateBlockchain addresses these challenges by utilizing blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that ensures trust, immutability, and decentralization.

This project aims to create a platform where buyers, sellers, agents, and other stakeholders can interact directly, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Through smart contracts, RealEstateBlockchain automates and executes real estate transactions, reducing delays, costs, and potential fraud.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Features

- **Decentralized Property Listings:** Users can list properties on the blockchain, providing all relevant details such as property description, location, price, and media.

- **Smart Contract-based Transactions:** RealEstateBlockchain facilitates secure and automated property transactions using smart contracts. Buyers and sellers can define the terms and conditions of their agreement, which are then executed automatically when met.

- **Immutable Property History:** Each property transaction is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable history of ownership and transfers. This feature enhances transparency and reduces the risk of fraudulent activities.

- **Secure and Transparent Escrow:** RealEstateBlockchain offers an escrow mechanism that holds funds until all parties meet the conditions defined in the smart contract. This ensures secure transactions and builds trust between buyers and sellers.

- **Identity Verification:** The platform integrates identity verification mechanisms to ensure that all users are legitimate. This feature helps prevent fraud and establishes a reliable network of participants.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RealEstateBlockchain.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the blockchain network settings in the `config.js` file.
4. Deploy the smart contracts to the blockchain network using the provided deployment script: `truffle migrate`
